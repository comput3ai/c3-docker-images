## Building Images üèóÔ∏è

Comput3.AI publishes these Docker images for transparency and to help the AI community. By making the build process open and accessible, we aim to foster collaboration and innovation in AI deployment.

### Building from Source

To build the standard set of Ollama images (small, medium, large), use the build script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/comput3/c3-docker-images.git
cd c3-docker-images/ollama
./build.sh
```

To build other variants (fast, all, coder), use Docker build directly:

```bash
cd ollama
docker build -f Dockerfile.fast -t comput3/ollama:fast .
```

For building the Open WebUI image:

```bash
cd open-webui
docker build -t comput3/open-webui:latest .
```

For building the ComfyUI image:

```bash
cd ComfyUI
docker build -t comput3/comfyui:latest .
```

For building the WhisperX Gradio image:

```bash
cd c3-whisperx-gradio
docker build -t comput3/whisperx-gradio:latest .
```

For building the CSM Gradio image:

```bash
cd c3-csm-gradio
docker build -t comput3/csm-gradio:latest .
```

### Build Time Considerations ‚è±Ô∏è

Building these images requires downloading the AI models, which can vary in time depending on your internet connection speed. The larger containers (especially the "all" and "large" variants) will take significantly longer to build.

Approximate build times on a 500Mbps connection:
- ü™∂ Small container: 3-6 minutes
- üèÉ Medium container: 9-18 minutes
- üêò Large container: 25-50 minutes
- üåü All container: 35-70 minutes
- üíª Coder container: 12-36 minutes
- üé® ComfyUI container: 15-30 minutes
- üé§ WhisperX Gradio container: 10-20 minutes
- üó£Ô∏è CSM Gradio container: 15-25 minutes

‚ö†Ô∏è If your connection is slower, build times will increase proportionally. Be patient - these models are worth the wait! ‚ö†Ô∏è
